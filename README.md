# PoC Upgradable Smart Contracts

The idea of having upgradable smart contracts is to update the logic of the contract for any potential bug in the Smart Contract.

## Limitations

The current version of Scilla has a limitation working with ADTs between two smart contracts, however, this can be handled by replacing custom ADT with variables.

This design approach wonâ€™t allow to add new variables in the State contract, however, new variables can be added in Collection Proxy, but there will be a state loss when a new proxy contract is updated.

## Architecture

Contracts will be spilt into multiple chunks based on the operations they perform.

1. State Contract
2. Logic Contract
3. Proxy Contract
4. Transfer Proxy Contract
5. Multisig Contract

### State Contract

This contract holds the complete state of the smart contract and its non-upgradable

### Logic Contract

This contract has access to State Contract to make the changes in state after validating the required conditions, this is an upgradable contract.

### Proxy Contract

This contract delegates the calls to Logic Contract and has permission to update Logic Contract.

### Transfer Proxy Contract

This contract acts as a treasury or operator while handing the ZRC2 & ZRC6 transfers. This is a non-upgradable contract. The logic contract will have access to this contract.

### Multisig Contract

This contract has access to the following and can be extended for other functionalities in the state, logic & proxy

1. Updating the logic contract in the state contract
2. Updating the logic contract in the proxy contract
3. Updating the logic contract in the transfer proxy contract

## Deployment

Follow the below process to deploy the smart contract, make sure you follow the same sequence of operations.

1. Deploy State Contract

Parameters required:

```bash
multiSig wallet
```

2. Deploy Proxy Contract

Parameters required:

```bash
multiSig wallet
```

3. Deploy Transfer Proxy Contract

Parameters required:

```bash
multiSig wallet
```

4. Deploy Logic Contract

Parameters required:

```bash
state contract (required) - refer to checkpoint 1
proxy contract (required) - refer to checkpoint 2
proxy contract (required) - refer to checkpoint 3
```

5. Update Logic Contract

a. update logic contract in state contract

```
UpdateLogic( -logic contract address- )
```

b. update logic contract in proxy contract

```
UpdateLogic( -logic contract address- )
```

c. update logic contract in transfer proxy contract

```
updateOperator( -logic contract address-, -status- )
```

6. Execute Transaction

We have successfully, deployed the contract and have the necessary permissions to execute the transaction.

We can call SampleZRCTransfer by passing the below parameters

```
token_address, from, to, amount
```

note: Make sure that you increase the allowance in ZRC2 token contract before you execute SampleZRCTransfer.

Execution Flow 1:

7. Upgrade Logic Contract

Deploy new logic smart contract with the update and fixes.

Parameters required:

```bash
state contract (required) - refer to checkpoint 1
proxy contract (required) - refer to checkpoint 2
proxy contract (required) - refer to checkpoint 3
```

8. follow step 5 in this section

9. follow step 6 to execute the transaction

Execution Flow 2:
